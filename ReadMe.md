# Exercise 22
In this exercise, we are going to practice some basic flexbox functionality.  Use what we learned in class to re-work specific components.

## Part 1 - Media Gallery Images

The floats and widths have been removed.  Add flexbox to make them behave like they do in the Dekstop First exercise from Exercise 21.  Final result will look and behave like this: [Flex Gallery](https://worthyd.github.io/dummy-sites/flex-gallery/).

## Part 2 - The main menu

Convert the main menu to use flexbox.  Any resolution below 550 needs to be a column. Any resolution above 550 needs to have `Home` appear in the third spot.

## Part 3 - The footer menu

Convert the footer menu to use flexbox.  Any resolution below 550 needs to be a column. Any resolution above 550 needs to have the links in a row, but in a reverse order.
